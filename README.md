# World_Weather_Analysis
## World Cities and Weather
This analysis examines over 500 cities from around the world to compare their weather data. The latitude of a city and its' temperature, humidity, cloudiness, or wind speed was graphed in a scatterplot. The only correlation visible is between latitude and max temperature in a day, no other factors seem to have any relation to latitude.

## Vacation Search
A search was done to find cities across the globe with a daily temperature between 70 and 80 degrees farenheit.  129 cities out of the original 567 cities chosen fit the criteria.

## Vacation Itinerary
Four cities from the total list are located in Colombia, South America. The highs for that area are in the low 70s, making for a great vacation spot. Unfortunately, there is no known route on Google Maps- biking, walking, or driving, to get from Purificacion (start point of the vacation), Mani, Mapiripan, to Inirida which is in the jungle on the Eastern border of the country. So, instead, one country from Venezuela is also included in the trip. I believe a local guide could help direct you to a bus or personal driver to explore that area if still interested.
